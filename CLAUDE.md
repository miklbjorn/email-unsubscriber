Always read the specs in specs/specs.md for project context. Keep an updated version of implementation plan and status in specs/plan.md. Update specs and plans as nescessary when design choices become clearer, and when implementation status changes. Provide succint high-level docs in specs/docs.md and provide super simple ADRs for any important choices in specs/adrs/NNN_decision.md files 

Aim for atomic commits on isolated changes, no big swings at the code base in one commit.
